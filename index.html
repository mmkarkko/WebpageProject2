                Ever since I was little, I have gravitated towards computers and
                technology. After trials and errors, here I am with a Bachelor
                of Science degree in Economics and Business Administration. I
                have discovered a deep passion for front-end development, an
                area where I aim to specialize and contribute meaningfully.
              </p>
              <p>
                My academic journey, coupled with hands-on experience, has
                equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and a growing
                interest in JavaScript, making these my strongest skills. In
                addition, I have a good foundation in programming languages,
                such as Java and C#. I am also familiar with Python and SQL as
                well, which further complement my set of skills and provide me
                with understanding of both front- and back-end development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my life, I have created several websites that have
                been published online. Although these sites are no longer
                available, they represent a significant part of my ongoing
                interest in web development and have continuously enhanced my
                skills. Working on these projects, I have found that I excel in
                creating responsive web pages and interactive user interfaces,
                combining my technical skills with my eye for design. My
                experience in graphic design further complements my web
                development abilities, allowing me to deliver visually appealing
                and user-friendly web experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my web development skills, I have a strong
                understanding of cybersecurity principles, gained through my
                academic studies. This knowledge enables me to implement best
                practices for web security, ensuring that the applications I
                develop are secure and resilient against common threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tackling challenges with a problem-solving mindset, I excel in
                communication both in Finnish and English. I value inclusivity
                in the workplace and thrive in environments that offer
                opportunities for continuous self-improvement. Excited to
                contribute my skills to collaborative teams and projects, aiming
                to deliver significant results in the field of web development.
                I thrive on opportunities to apply my passion and diverse skill
                set to drive impactful outcomes.
